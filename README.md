# S3-to-SQL-with-ADF-Lambda-Triggers
This project demonstrates how to automate the process of loading data from an Amazon S3 bucket into an Azure SQL database using Azure Data Factory (ADF) triggered by an AWS Lambda function. The pipeline is initiated whenever a new CSV file is uploaded to the S3 bucket, and the file is dynamically processed and stored in the SQL database.
